Project Synopsis:
ABC Walk-in Clinic is located in a large metropolitan city in Canada. The clinic staff
consists of ten doctors, six nurses, five office secretaries, two administrative
assistants and one manager. First time Patients have to visit the clinic personally
and fill a registration form that contains their personal and health related
information. An office secretary would then enter that information in the computer
based information system.

Patients may become a permanent patient (at any time) for one of the doctors at
the clinic by filling up necessary forms (they are called enrolled patients) or they
may choose to come walk-in for every visit. (They usually called walk-in patients)
Enrolled Patients may book their appointments online or by calling, the office and
one of the secretaries would then book their appointment with their doctor on a
particular day/time. Any booked appointment may be cancelled up to 24 hours in
advance after which the clinic charges a fifty-dollar fine.
 
During a visit to the clinic, a patient reports to the secretary and she either puts him
in the walk-in queue or in case of patients with existing appointments, checks them
in. A Nurse then takes the patient to an examination room and writes down about
her symptoms and other medical issues and then based on each individual patient’s
needs may take their blood pressure, temperature, height, and weight and then
enters all this information in the computer system.

The clinic system should keep a track of patients’ appointments and change the
status accordingly: booked, cancelled, arrived, checked in, checked out, LWT(left
without treatment), No show etc. Healthcare is free in Canada and most people are
not charged any fee (clinic is paid by the government), however sometime a small
fee is charged for items not covered by the government such as Sick notes or fee is
charged from the patients who are not covered under the government health
coverage (visitors etc.)

Next, the doctor examines the patient and may order some diagnostic tests for the
patient (blood work, XRAY, Ultrasound etc). The doctor will enter patient
symptoms, her diagnosis and treatment (prescription medicines). The system
should have the capability to store all of the above information entered by the
doctor for a patient’s visit. The doctor may also refer the patient to a specialist
doctor and store this information in the system.
When the results come back from the Laboratory, one of the nurses will review all
the reports and enter them in each patients file (electronic file within the clinic system).
She may also call a patient to book a follow up appointment with a doctor
in case of adverse results.

The clinic runs in two six hour shifts (7a.m to 2p.m) and (2p.m to 8p.m). Manager
should be able to schedule doctors, nurses, and secretaries for shifts. 

Doctors are paid by the government but the Manager is supposed to pay salary to all other
employees based on their hours worked. The system should be able to store this
information and the manager should be able to generate a bi weekly report for the
hours worked by the nurses and secretaries and therefore calculate their salaries
(assume reasonable hourly rates for nurses and secretaries).
